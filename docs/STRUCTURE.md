# Repository structure

This repository builds PocketJS firmware for M5Stack boards. It consumes
PocketJS as the `third_party/pocketjs` submodule and follows the directory
split of pocketjs `main` (pocket-nexus/pocketjs#603): **platforms** hold SDK
and board drivers, and **programs** compose drivers into firmware with a
host config and the **host contract** (`pocket.host.json`), the facts apps
compile and are admitted against. The launcher, Pocket Home, is `apps/pocket-home`.

## Ownership

**PocketJS adapters are board-independent.** `pocket_worker_esp`,
`pocket_http_esp` and `pocket_io_esp` implement the worker host and its
`http`, `i2c` and `uart` nodes against ESP-IDF APIs. They take their configuration from the program, not from a
board. A board support component for one board would go in
`platforms/esp-idf/m5_bsp_<board>/`.

**The program composes and configures.** `programs/m5stack-tab5/main/main.c`
brings up the board through Espressif's `m5stack_tab5_noglib` BSP, creates the
display, input and renderers, starts the launcher services and boots one
runtime per app. The program owns its host contract (`pocket.host.json`);
the host config `pocket.host.config.ts` names it. The build exports
`pocket_profile.h`, whose `pocket_profile.facts` record the runtime admits
packages against, and compiles Pocket Home (`apps/pocket-home`) and the
bundled apps with the same host config.

**Components one program uses stay with that program.**
`programs/m5stack-tab5/components/` holds the launcher services, camera,
media, audio (`audio.pcm`, `audio.capture`) and device (`system.device`)
components of that firmware. It builds on board-independent drivers
from the submodule (`pocket_display_esp_dpi`, `pocket_render_esp_ppa` with
its two-lane factory, `pocket_runner`); it reads the microSD card over SDSPI
because the ESP32-C6 radio takes the SDMMC controller.

**The host contract admits apps by facts.** A package boots its first variant
whose binding generation, raster density, animation class, tick rate,
viewport, presentation, capabilities and auxiliary surface the host contract
provides (pocket-nexus/pocketjs#631); the profile hash only orders variants.
A package compiled for another host with the same facts installs, and a
change to the contract that removes a fact an app uses refuses that app until
it is rebuilt. Each app states `app.tickHz` 30, the Tab5's one cadence.

## Upstream components

The program adds these submodule components through `EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`:

| Component | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `pocket_runtime` | one Rust archive (runtime, software renderer, PPA factory), host hooks, memory package source, CMake package helpers |
| `pocket_guest_quickjs` | QuickJS realm with the generated guest bindings |
| `pocket_runner` | the task that ticks a runtime |
| `pocket_render_esp_ppa` | ESP32-P4 PPA renderer with software fallback |
| `pocket_display_esp_dpi` | strips into one DPI framebuffer, with rotation, scaling and retained moves |

The Rust archive builds from `third_party/pocketjs/programs/esp-idf/archive`
with the submodule's toolchain pin (`rust-toolchain.toml`) unless a prepared
archive is passed with `POCKET_RUNTIME_ARCHIVE`.

## JavaScript workspace

The root `package.json` declares `third_party/pocketjs` as a Bun workspace, so
`@pocketjs/framework` resolves to the submodule and its dependencies install
once at the root. `tools/pocket` runs the submodule's CLI; the CMake helpers
call it through `POCKETJS_CLI`. The apps under `apps/`, Pocket Home
included, compile with that CLI, and their imports resolve to the root's
`node_modules`.
